# Blacktree
# Introduction
Blacktree is where backend APIs become plug-and-play â€” for yourself, your team, or anyone on the internet. It lets you deploy your microservice, web server, or any kind of backend service with just a Dockerfile â€” no server setup, no YAML, no DevOps hassle.

Whether it's a personal API, a SaaS backend, or an internal tool, Blacktree makes it instantly live, scalable, and sharable.

##  Key Features
#### Click Deployment from GitHub
Just push code to your repository â€” Blacktree automatically builds and deploys it.

#### CI/CD Built-in
Webhook-based CI triggers builds on every push. You get seamless auto-redeploys for updated code.

#### Docker-Native
Build any language or framework. If it runs in Docker, it runs on Blacktree.

#### Autoscaling Worker System
Deployments are handled by a dynamic pool of workers that build images using BuildKit and push them to ECR. They automatically register to orchestrator when scalling up. 

#### Serverless Deployment via AWS ECS Fargate
Your services run on secure, scalable infrastructure â€” no server management required.

#### Real-time Logs and Status (logs coming soon)
Monitor deployments, view logs, and get live feedback directly from your dashboard.

#### Private or Public Deployments 
Choose to keep your service internal or expose it to the internet with a secure, sharable URL.

#### Secure Authentication 
Built-in support for GitHub OAuth and Clerk-based user sessions for access control.

#### API Analytics (Coming Soon)
Usage metrics, request logs, error rates â€” all visualized.

#### Custom Environment Variables
Configure your deployment with secrets and runtime variables.
